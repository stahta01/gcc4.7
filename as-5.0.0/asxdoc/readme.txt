ASxxxx and ASlink V4.10 January 2006

   The  ASxxxx  assemblers are a series of microprocessor assem-
blers written in the C programming  language.   This  collection
contains  cross  assemblers  for the 1802, S2650, MPS430, 61860,
6500,  6800(6802/6808),  6801(hd6303),  6804,  6805,  68HC(S)08,
6809,  68HC11,  68HC(S)12,  68HC16,  740, 8051, 8085(8080), AVR,
DS8xCxxx, ez80, F2MC8L/FX,  GameBoy(Z80),  H8/3xx,  PIC,  Rabbit
2000/3000,  z8,  and  z80(hd64180)  series  microprocessors. The
companion program ASLINK is a relocating linker  supporting  all
the cross assemblers.  ASLINK also supports object files created
with V3.xx assemblers.  The  assemblers  and  linker  have  been
tested using  Linux, DJGPP, Cygwin, Symantec C/C++ V7.2, Borland
Turbo C++ 3.0  and  VC6 with MS-DOS / Windows 3.x/9x/NT/2000/XP.
Complete source code  and  documentation  for the assemblers and
linker is included with the  distribution.   Additionally,  test
code  for  each  assembler  and  several microprocessor monitors
(ASSIST05  for  the  6805,  MONDEB  and  ASSIST09  for the 6809,
and  BUFFALO 2.5 for the 6811) are included as  working examples
of use of these assemblers.  

asxv4p00.zip	ASxxxx and ASlink V4.00 Zipped

	MS-DOS:
	DJGPP:		pkunzip -d asxv4p00.zip
			unzips and restores directory structure
